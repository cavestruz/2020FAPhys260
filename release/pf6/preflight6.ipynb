More complex circuits, or more complex input signal, do not have easy paths to an exact solution.\n",

Increasing the number of timesteps (i.e. refining the time resolution) is in fact something that might be desireable for a given problem.  First, plot the spring behavior with the naive assumption that you can continue as before.  You will notice that the plot shows a change in period for the time correpsonding to the third call of the `evolve_spring` method.  Note - you'll need to add the same code below using zip as you did before. "

    "Now, take the code from the cell above, and modify it in the cell below to account for the higher time resolution to get an appropriate plot.  The crux of this is to redifine `time_period_units` so the values for time (x-axis-values) are no longer evenly spaced.   \n",

Then, you'll want to keep the timesteps for the last (third) call of the method `evolve_spring`, perhaps naming this `time_period_units_before`, and this should start right after the last value of `time_period_units_before`. You can then use `np.concatenate` to create one entire `time_period_units` for plotting from this.  \n",

You are welcome to try adding such an attribute to the definition of `Spring`, or you can make the correction only for the figure as described in the hint above.  If you try adding such an attribute, this could look like a list, `self.spring_evolution_config`, where each list item is a tuple (`num_timesteps`, `dt`) that gets appended every time `evolve_spring` gets called (and `_set_num_timesteps` gets called).
